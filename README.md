VBA Challenge Using Generated Stock Market Data provided by UNCC Data Analytics Boot Camp

The purpose of this project was to diplay changes over time in stock data from the first open of a given year to the final close of that year.
And use those two respective data points to calculate the percentage of those changes. Total stock volume was also calculated and the greatest value was listed with its corresponding ticker code in a separate table along with largest positive and negative percent changes.
This project displays proficiency in seeking data in Excel using Visual Basic with For Loops being the primary formula for each of the four calculations presented with the raw data.
